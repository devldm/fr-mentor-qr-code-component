## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

### Quick notes

- This was a fun challenge to get back to basics - I've become all too used to starting a new next.js project.
- tailwind is somewhat overkill here but i'm trying to get used to using it. In some ways it even made following the style guide harder as we had to add to the tailwind config.
- This was fun! Excited to do more
- It's not a perfect recreation but i'm okay with that.
